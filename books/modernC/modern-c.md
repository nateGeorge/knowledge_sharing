# Modern C by Jens Gusdet

### Some early takeaways

- C is not the same as C++, but similar. C++ sort of builds on C. 
- C is imperative - uses statements (instructions/commands) that change a programs state.
- C is a compiled language
- C is portable between different platforms - but has to be written correctly and can't use specific extensions only on some platforms. Compling prepares the program to assembly language
